- __Hamburger Menu__
    - When the user is using mobile device the navigation bar turns to a "Hamburger Menu" for them to easily click and see the other accesible pages. This was done with some minor JavaScript.

### Features Left to Implement
- The feature I would like to add next is some sort of form for the user to fill out, there will be some questions asking what type of goal the user has with the training session that I can provide and also if the user has some questions for me to answer.

## Validator Tests
The tests I ran to see wether or not the integrity of the HTML & CSS was valid were done on W3C. I also ran a perfomance test on Google Lighthouse. Down below I have provided screenshots to show credability and what kind of results I got by doing these tests.
- HTML

## Bugs
- Because this was my first ever project I stumbled upon a few bugs that I solved eventually, some of them included the navigation bar not being responsive and other issues appeared that were causing some sort of overflow and the screen got a horizontal scroll-bar.


## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SanZangana/gutsfitness), navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the **Main** Branch, then click "Save".

## Credit
- I would first and foremost thank my CI Mentor Tim Nelson for guiding me for my first ever project, he has been teaching me how to fix issues regarding the project.
- Code Institutes own modules consisting of videos and valuable information regarding HTML & CSS have also been a great contributor to this website
- The inspiration for this website was not taken from any particular source, I've always been intrested in training and fitness so the website is more of a manifestation of my own ideas.
