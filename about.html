        <h3>Why choose me?</h3>
        <p>Well, because I have been on both spectrums of the fitness industry (overweight & underweight) I can truly relate to both body types and help YOU find your sweet spot!
            I also value your time, so I will make sure that my programme is suitable for your schedule.
            Down below I've made a gallery using my own pictures for reference.
        </p>
